    <h2 >My First Blog Post</h2>
    <hr class="dotline">
    <p>This is the first paragraph of my blog post. I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you all. In this post, I will <br> be talking about my day.</p>
<p>Let's start with my morning. I woke up early and had a cup of coffee. Then, I decided to go for a walk in the park. It was a <br> beautiful sunny day, and the birds were singing. I saw many people walking their dogs and children playing. It was very <br> refreshing.</p>
